# Holiday Plugin

![https://github.com/Ghawken/Holiday/blob/main/Images/holiday.png?raw=true](https://github.com/Ghawken/Holiday/blob/main/Images/holiday.png?raw=true)

This is a relatively simple plugin (well aren't they all?) which allows you to select country and region, and then will update a variable as to whether today or tomorrow is a Holiday

It basically is a wrapper for the python-holidays library which collates this information for multiple countries/regions.

see here:
https://pypi.org/project/holidays/

## Install

Only compatible with Indigo 2023.2 - as it can now download the 2 libraries needed - one of which is obviously the holidays package

Double click plugin Bundle

## Plugin Config Settings Only

#### Select Country and/or Region

Go to Plugin Config

Select Country, Region, language and/or categories of holidays (beware some of these are 'public' holidays which is default)

Press log Holidays to see what holidays are registered, recorded for checking

To check Holidays that plugin is aware of can run Menu item
Log all Holidays once these details are selected.

eg.
```

   Holiday                         ================================================================  ================================================================
```

Thats it.

There will be a variable called
Holiday_Today:  true or false
Holiday_Tomorrow: true or false
in folder Holidays

This will be updated once a day/and/or on startup or any issues.

## Action Group

Enables forcing Holiday Today or Holiday Tomorrow to True or False, or return to Library default settings.  This overrides the library settings.

This is saved, and survives Indigo or Plugin restarts.  So to reset rerun the action setting as needed.

Setting Holiday tomorrow to True, sets the variable Holiday_tomorrow to true, at midnight Holiday_tomorrow becomes false, and Holiday_today is then 
also forced true.  Another day passes and they are both negative (if no real holiday)

### Usage:
Ideally would suggest Force Holiday tomorrow is used day before actual holiday so triggers early in day are caught
eg.
Button press for temporary holiday, at midnight Holiday_Today becomes true and if using for scheduled alarm - then appropriate morning routine not triggered.





## Usage

As a conditional trigger for schedules etc. to run

Alarm clock:
Condition:
If Holiday_Today is false


## Check the holidays listed

I have found that it is very good, but there is one 'Bank Holiday' it lists for me which isn't a 'public holiday'.  
Was a bit slow to work that day when alarm didn't go off.... not completely sure anyone understood my excuse!
